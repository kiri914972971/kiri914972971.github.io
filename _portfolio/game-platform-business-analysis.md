## Project Background
Steam hosts a wide variety of games with different pricing models, discount strategies, and user feedback dynamics.  
Understanding how pricing and promotions influence consumer behavior and game ratings is critical for platform growth, developer support, and monetization strategy.

This project focuses on analyzing game-level data from a digital game platform to uncover patterns in pricing, discount behavior, and rating outcomes, and to translate these findings into actionable business insights.

---

## Business Questions
- How do different pricing and discount strategies affect consumer appeal across games?  
- What key factors influence whether a game achieves a high rating on the platform?  
- Can games be meaningfully segmented to support differentiated pricing, bundling, and marketing strategies?  

---

## Data & Approach
- The dataset includes game attributes such as price, discount rate, release time, user reviews, ratings, and platform support features  
- Combined **unsupervised learning** (clustering) and **supervised learning** (classification) techniques to address both segmentation and prediction tasks  

---

## What I Did
- Cleaned and prepared raw game-level data for analysis  
- Applied clustering techniques to segment games into distinct groups based on pricing behavior, discount patterns, and product characteristics  
- Built Logistic Regression and machine learning models to identify key factors associated with high game ratings  
- Interpreted model outputs with a focus on **business implications**, rather than purely technical performance  

---

## Key Insights
- Games can be grouped into distinct clusters that respond differently to pricing and promotion strategies, suggesting that a one-size-fits-all approach is ineffective  
- Discount rate and base price both have a significant impact on game ratings, but their effects vary across clusters  
- User reviews, platform support, and game age play important roles in shaping rating outcomes  
- Aggressive discounting alone does not guarantee higher ratings and may weaken perceived product value  

---

## Business Implications
- Platform operators can apply **cluster-specific pricing and promotion strategies** to improve marketing efficiency  
- Insights from rating drivers can support better developer guidance and platform recommendation mechanisms  
- A data-driven understanding of pricing and ratings helps balance short-term promotions with long-term platform value

## 中文项目摘要

本项目基于某数字游戏平台的游戏级数据，从定价、折扣策略与用户评分三个核心维度出发，  
系统性分析不同游戏在平台上的表现差异，并挖掘影响高评分的关键因素。

### 研究目标
- 分析不同定价与折扣策略对消费者吸引力的影响  
- 识别影响游戏评分高低的关键因素  
- 通过聚类分析对游戏进行分组，为差异化营销和定价策略提供支持  

### 分析方法
- 对游戏价格、折扣率、用户评价、平台支持等变量进行清洗与分析  
- 采用聚类分析对游戏进行分群，刻画不同类型游戏的特征  
- 使用 Logistic Regression 与机器学习模型识别高评分游戏的关键影响因素  
- 从业务角度解读分析结果，强调可落地性而非单纯模型指标  

### 核心发现
- 不同游戏分群在价格敏感度和促销响应上存在显著差异  
- 折扣率、价格水平、用户评价数量、平台支持以及游戏生命周期均与评分结果密切相关  
- 过度依赖折扣并不能保证评分提升，反而可能削弱产品长期价值  

### 业务价值
- 支持平台制定更精细化的定价与促销策略  
- 为开发者提供数据驱动的定价与产品优化参考  
- 提升平台在用户推荐与内容分发层面的决策质量
