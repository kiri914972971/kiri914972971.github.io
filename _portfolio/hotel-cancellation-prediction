## Project Background
Hotel booking cancellations can lead to significant revenue loss and operational inefficiency.  
This project aims to predict whether a booking will be cancelled based on customer and booking-related features.

## Data & Problem
- Dataset includes booking information such as lead time, deposit type, customer type, and room preferences  
- The main task is a **binary classification problem**: cancellation vs. non-cancellation  

## What I Did
- Performed data cleaning and feature engineering  
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns  
- Built and evaluated classification models to predict cancellation risk  
- Interpreted model results from a **business perspective**, not just accuracy  

## Key Insights
- Lead time and deposit type were strong predictors of cancellation  
- Bookings without deposits showed significantly higher cancellation rates  
- Predictive modeling can support overbooking and pricing strategies  

## Tools & Skills
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)  
- Machine learning for classification  
- Business analysis & data storytelling
