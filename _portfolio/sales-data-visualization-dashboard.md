## Project Background
Sales teams and management require timely and intuitive insights to track performance and identify potential issues.  
This project focuses on building a **sales performance monitoring dashboard** that consolidates key metrics and enables multi-dimensional analysis.

---

## Business Objectives
- Monitor overall sales performance through key KPIs  
- Compare sales outcomes across regions and provinces  
- Identify trends and anomalies in sales volume, customer count, and average order value  
- Support data-driven operational and management decisions  

---

## Dashboard Design
The dashboard provides a structured overview of sales performance, including:
- Core KPIs such as total sales amount, number of customers, and average order value  
- Regional and provincial breakdowns to highlight performance differences  
- Time-series trends to track changes over the reporting period  
- Period-based comparisons to evaluate sales cycle effectiveness  

---

## Key Insights
- Sales performance varies significantly across regions, with certain provinces consistently outperforming others  
- Growth in total sales is not always driven by customer growth, highlighting the importance of monitoring average order value  
- Period-based analysis reveals uneven sales distribution, suggesting opportunities for process and incentive optimization

## 中文项目摘要

本项目通过数据可视化的方式，对公司月度销售数据进行集中展示与监控，  
帮助管理层快速掌握整体销售表现，并识别区域差异与潜在问题。

### 项目目标
- 监控核心销售指标（成交额、客户数、客单价）  
- 对不同区域与省份的销售表现进行对比分析  
- 通过趋势分析发现异常波动与潜在风险  
- 支持管理层进行数据驱动的业务决策  

### 核心发现
- 不同区域销售表现差异明显，需采取差异化管理策略  
- 销售增长并非完全由客户数量驱动，客单价变化同样关键  
- 分期与时间维度分析有助于优化销售节奏与激励机制  

该 Dashboard 可作为销售管理与经营分析的基础工具，为持续监控与决策支持提供数据基础。
